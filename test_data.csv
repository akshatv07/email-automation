I hope you are doing well.

Apologies for the delay in the repayment of my EMI. Due to some unavoidable
circumstances, I have been unable to make the payment just yet. However,
please be assured that I am fully committed to clearing the dues and am
currently awaiting some incoming funds.

It would be very helpful if the follow-up calls could be paused for at
least the next week, as I am working on arranging the required amount. I
will make the part payment before *23rd** July*

Thank you for your patience and support during this time. I truly
appreciate your understanding.

I’m writing to formally raise a concern regarding the repeated auto-debit attempts made on my bank account every day, sometimes 4–5 times, for different amounts. These repeated NACH hits have now pushed my ICICI savings account into a negative balance of over ₹42,000, despite having insufficient funds to honor even the first attempt.  Here are a few sample messages I’ve received:   'Your account is not debited with ₹736.88 towards INNOFIN SOLUTIO for Autopay due to CBS rejection...' 'Your account is not debited with ₹3673.75... RRN: 512276630902'   This kind of repeated debit activity feels extremely excessive, especially when I’ve clearly indicated my current financial hardship. I would like to understand the legal or RBI-backed justification for triggering multiple debit mandates on the same day — is this part of your policy, and is it compliant with RBI guidelines on recovery and NACH presentation?  I would also like to understand:    Why your system is making repeated debit attempts multiple times daily even after failed transactions?    Whether this has been reported to the bank (ICICI), as it is now affecting my account health.    What option you offer to pause auto-debit and discuss a settlement.    Until a proper explanation is given, and my account is restored to normalcy, I must refuse to make any further payments under these conditions. I am not denying the debt, but this kind of pressure is unfair and financially damaging. I am also seeking legal advice regarding this situation, including possible RBI Ombudsman escalation, if required.  Looking forward to your immediate clarification and support.

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that I am currently facing serious financial
difficulties due to [job loss / salary delay / medical emergency / personal
crisis – choose your reason]. As a result, I am temporarily unable to repay
my loan EMIs on time.

Please understand that this is not intentional, and I have always tried to
maintain a good repayment record. However, due to my present financial
condition, it has become extremely difficult to meet my obligations.

I kindly request you to consider the following:

   -

   A temporary hold or extension on my EMI payments,
   -

   A restructuring of the loan, or
   -

   Any available hardship assistance program from your end.

I assure you that I am committed to repaying the loan and will resume
payments as soon as my situation improves. I am happy to provide any
documents needed to support my request.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. I look forward to your
kind support in this difficult time.

Warm regards,

1st August 2025 to make the payment in full.

I also request you to kindly hold off on sending any field collection
agents, as I am already in communication with you and am making
efforts to resolve the matter. Your cooperation in this situation will

Please confirm whether my request can be considered. I assure you that

3648440,Request for Late Fee Waiver Due to Medical Emergency,"Satyam Priya :  Hello InstaMoney Team,     I have already made it clear that the current EMI will be paid in full by 20th July without fail. I stand by this commitment and have never denied my obligation. I have also clearly stated that I have no intention of defaulting. My payment history reflects a consistent record of timely repayments every month, without exception.  This month, due to an unavoidable emergency, there has been a one-time delay of two weeks, which I had communicated in advance. Despite this, I am being subjected to persistent and excessive calls and intimidation, which is causing undue mental harassment. This behavior is completely unwarranted and must cease immediately.  I reiterate—no further action is required from your side. Kindly respect the given timeline and wait until 20th July, as previously communicated.

As previously communicated, there were specific delays in repayment during the months of April and July. In accordance with the terms outlined in your Loan Agreement and the Key Fact Statement, penalties have been automatically applied for each instance of delay. These charges are system-generated and non-discretionary, based strictly on the contractual terms agreed upon at the time of loan disbursement.  With respect to your request for a waiver of these penalties, we regret to inform you that we are unable to accommodate this request. The charges have been applied as per the system logic and policy guidelines, and we are bound to uphold the terms agreed with both borrowers and our lending partners.  To prevent any further accumulation of charges, we strongly recommend that you clear the overdue EMI at the earliest. Once the pending EMI is successfully paid, the system will automatically stop accruing any additional delay charges.  After the EMI is cleared, you may proceed to pay the remaining applicable dues to initiate loan account closure. Timely resolution of these dues will help prevent further financial burden and also ensure that your credit profile remains in good standing.  Additionally, please note that maintaining a strong repayment history is crucial for safeguarding your credit bureau records, including your CIBIL score, and for ensuring continued access to credit in the future.

Frankly, this feels like predatory lending — exploiting a customer’s vulnerable situation under the cover of a signed agreement.     Please understand, I am not refusing to pay the EMI of ₹14,577. I am simply unable to bear the additional burden of the excessive late fees being applied over the past few days.     As a loyal and regular customer, I sincerely request InstaMoney to treat this as a one-time exception and allow me to make the EMI payment of ₹14,577 without any late fees or penalties for the past four days.     I urge you to escalate this matter internally and help me find a fair solution. I am ready to make the EMI payment as this gets resolved.     Thank you for your understanding and support.

I had a medical emergency in my family and was away attending to it, which is why I missed the EMI payment due on 1st July. I’m back and prepared to make the payment.   However, I noticed that the current EMI amount has risen to ₹17,632, while the original EMI due was ₹14,577. This implies a difference of over ₹3,000, which I assume includes penalties or late fees.If you are charging nearly ₹1,000 per day as penalty, I must say that is extremely excessive, unreasonable, and unfair—especially for a loyal and regular customer like me who has been using InstaMoney for almost a year now.   I respectfully request you to treat this as a one-time delay and waive the late fees applied over the original EMI amount. I am ready to pay the base EMI of ₹14,577.   Please understand my situation and consider this appeal. If this is not accepted, I will be forced to stop using InstaMoney for any future borrowing, as the fee structure is too expensive and unfair and fails to consider genuine customer situations.  . I assure you that I will make all upcoming EMI payments on time without fail.  Looking forward to your fair consideration and confirmation.  Best regards, Satyam Priya"

3648541,Subject: Request for Update on Loan Settlement – [Loan ID: LOA-5TPXRSBM],"jitendra sen :  Subject: Request for Reconsideration of Loan Settlement – Genuine Financial Hardship  Dear InstaMoney Team,  Greetings!  I hope this message finds you well.  I'm writing once again with deep respect and a sincere request regarding my loan account. I completely understand that, as per your current policy, settlement or waiver of charges may not be available. However, I’m going through a very difficult financial phase and would like to request your kind reconsideration for a one-time settlement option.  Due to personal and unavoidable circumstances, I’m currently facing financial hardship and have already fallen behind on multiple obligations. My intention has never been to default or avoid my responsibilities — in fact, I’m trying to clear all my dues one by one, but due to limited monthly income, it’s becoming extremely difficult.  A settlement option will genuinely help me come out of this financial mess and reduce the stress, while also ensuring closure of the loan in good faith.  Kindly forward my request to the concerned department or higher authority for review. Even if part payment settlement is possible in 2–3 phases, I would be grateful.  Looking forward to your kind understanding and support.  Name: Jitendra Sen Registered Mobile: 8619675952 Loan Amount: ₹15,867 (Current Due) Total Outstanding: ₹20,353  Thank you for your patience and cooperation.

Here are my loan details:    Loan ID: LOA-5TPXRSBM    Current Due Amount: ₹15867    Total Outstanding Amount: ₹20353    At this point, I am unable to continue with regular EMIs, but I am willing to settle the account respectfully in a mutually agreed one-time payment if any discount or waiver can be provided.  Kindly consider my situation and provide me with a suitable settlement option that I can manage. Please let me know what documents are required to process this request.  Looking forward to your positive response.  Regards, Jitendra Sen Mobile: 8619675952 Email: shibhusen1407@gmail.com"

3648557,Re: CIBIL Closure: Limited Offer – Pay Your INSTAMONEY Dues and Get CIBIL Update,"Dear InstaMoney Team,

Thank you for reaching out and for providing the CIBIL closure offer.

However, I would like to bring to your attention that I had earlier
received a settlement offer of *₹2,880* for the full and final closure of
my loan. Due to my financial condition, I was unable to act on it
immediately.

I kindly request you to *reconsider and re-offer the same settlement amount
of ₹2,880*. I assure you that I will make the payment *immediately upon
receiving confirmation* of this revised offer.

I am sincerely looking to close this loan and improve my credit profile.
Your cooperation in this matter will be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

Warm regards,
*Mohd Shareef Ansari*
