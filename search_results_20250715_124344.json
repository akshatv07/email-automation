The possible reason for the rejection has been sent to your registered email address and can also be viewed in your application dashboard.\n\nPlease note that the registration fee is non-refundable, as it covers the cost of credit assessment and verification, which are completed during the application process.\n\nWe recommend reviewing the reason provided and addressing any issues before reapplying.
