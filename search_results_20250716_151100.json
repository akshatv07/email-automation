Please allow us to clarify that this fee is charged to cover the costs involved in processing your loan application, including credit evaluation, verification, and system checks carried out by our lending partners.\n\nAs mentioned in our Terms of Service, this registration fee is non-refundable, regardless of whether the loan is approved or rejected. This is because the fee is used to carry out the necessary verification and assessment each time an application is submitted.\n\nWe appreciate your understanding in this matter. You are always welcome to apply again, and we encourage you to ensure your credit and financial details are accurate to improve your chances of approval.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any further questions.\n\nBest regards,\nTeam Instamoney"
